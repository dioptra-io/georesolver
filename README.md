# üó∫Ô∏è GeoResolver

GeoResolver is an internet-scale IP address geolocation engine (supporting both IPv4 and IPv6), designed to operate on the RIPE Atlas platform. Its primary objective is to infer the relative distance between a target IP address and a set of vantage points with known geolocations, leveraging ECS-DNS redirection similarity.

Based on this similarity metric, GeoResolver selects a fixed subset of 50 RIPE Atlas vantage points and performs ping measurements, achieving near-optimal geolocation accuracy ‚Äî comparable to using the full set of available vantage points.

# üìã Content

This repository contains all the code, workflows, and data required to both replicate and reproduce the main results of GeoResolver.

- **Replication** refers to rerunning our original experiments with the same inputs to validate the published results.

- **Reproduction** enables researchers to apply the methodology to new datasets or target IP addresses of their choosing.

You can also conduct your own experiments using GeoResolver to geolocate custom sets of target IP addresses.
Note that GeoResolver relies on RIPE Atlas for performing active ping measurements, which are central to its geolocation inference process. To run measurements, you will need a [RIPE Atlas account](https://atlas.ripe.net/) and sufficient credits.

All components of GeoResolver are **open-source and publicly available**.

# üö© Prerequisites

GeoResolver relies on the following dependencies:
- [Docker >= 28.0.1](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Python >= 3.10.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Golang >= 1.23.1](https://go.dev/doc/install)

The remainder of this tutorial will guide you through the installation of all other required resources.
Note: Due to the large-scale nature of GeoResolver, the associated artifacts requires sufficient storage. To fully replicate the original experiments, we recommend having at least 15 GB of available storage (total size of artifacts is 9.4GB). 

# üß™ Test environments

We tested GeoResolver on the following software/hardware setup:
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04.5 LTS
- CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5122 CPU @ 3.60GHz, x86_64, 12 cores
- RAM: 250G
- Docker: 28.0.1
- Python: 3.10.12
- Poetry: 1.1.12
- Clickhouse-server: 22.6
- Clickhouse-client: 22.2.2.1
- ZDNS: 2.0.4

# üîß Installation

The following steps will guide you throught GeoResolver's project installation.

## Install GeoResolver

First of all, clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dioptra-io/georesolver.git
cd georesolver
```

GeoResolver uses poetry as python virtual environment and packet manager, you can install it with:
```bash
pip install poetry
```

Finally, install GeoResolver:
```bash
poetry lock && poetry install
```

Depending on the version of poetry you installed, you can activate GeoResolver virtual environement either with:
```bash
poetry shell
```

Or, in new poetry version, virtual env is activated with:
```bash
poetry env activate
```
And python scripts are run with:
```bash
poetry run python <my_beautiful_script.py>
```

## Install Clickhouse

GeoResolver uses [Clickhouse](https://clickhouse.com/docs) as database management system. First, install **Clickhouse client** with:
```bash
curl -fsSL 'https://packages.clickhouse.com/rpm/lts/repodata/repomd.xml.key' | gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/clickhouse-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/clickhouse-keyring.gpg] https://packages.clickhouse.com/deb stable main" | tee \
    /etc/apt/sources.list.d/clickhouse.list
apt-get update && apt-get install --yes clickhouse-client
```
If outadated, check [Clickhouse installation](https://clickhouse.com/docs/install) link for updated installation commands.

Once done, install and start the **Clickhouse server** using docker:
```bash
docker run -d \
    -p 127.0.0.1:8123:8123 \
    -p 127.0.0.1:9000:9000 \
    -e CLICKHOUSE_MAX_QUERY_SIZE=10000000000000000000 \
    -v <clickhouse_storage_dir>/data:/var/lib/clickhouse/ \
    -v <clickhouse_storage_dir>/logs:/var/log/clickhouse-server/ \
    --ulimit nofile=262144:262144 \
    clickhouse/clickhouse-server:22.6
```

Finally, create GeoResolver database using the following command:
```bash
clickhouse-client --query="CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS GeoResolver"
```

## Install ZDNS

GeoResolver relies on ECS-enabled DNS requests to identify the most suitable set of vantage points for geolocating a given target IP address. To perform these queries, we use [ZDNS](https://github.com/zmap/zdns), a high-performance DNS resolver capable of handling large-scale lookups at speed.

First, check that you have correctly installed golang:
```bash
go version
```

If not, install it with:
```bash
wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.22.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz

tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz

rm go1.22.2.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

Once done, clone ZDNS github repository, compile the project and copy the produced binary into ZDNS's directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zmap/zdns.git
cd zdns && go build && cd -
cp zdns/zdns georesolver/zdns/zdns_binary && rm -rf zdns/
```

Check that ZDNS installation works properly:
```bash
echo "www.example.org" | georesolver/zdns/zdns_binary A --name-servers 8.8.8.8
```

## Setup credentials

GeoResolver search all credentials into a .env files. First create it at the root of this repository:
```bash
touch .env
```
Copy-paste the content of **.env.example** within it. If you made changes (such as CLickhouse password/username or database), modify the .env file accordingly. Do not forget to set your RIPE Atlas API key as well.

# üóÇÔ∏è Download artifacts

Because of their size, all GeoResolver artifacts are available on our FTP serveur at: [ftp://132.227.123.74/CoNEXT_artifacts/]().
These artifacts are composed of two parts:
1. A zip archive withh all necessary files, such as domain names, CAIDA AS to organization, ITDK ICMP responsive IP addresses, etc.
2. All necessary Clickhouse tables.

## Download and extract archive

First, download the archive containing all necessary artifacts with:
```bash
curl -u CoNEXT_artifacts_user:61d0b0f7-0c54-4196-886b-4bcc6b0a0638 'ftp://132.227.123.74/CoNEXT_artifacts/datasets.zip' -o datasets.zip

mkdir -p georesolver/datasets

unzip datasets.zip -d georesolver/datasets/
```

**Description**:
- **itdk**: This folder contains all files related with the ITDK dataset (all IP addresses/ICMP responsive IP addresses, etc.). Original dataset can be found at [CAIDA ITDK](https://www.caida.org/catalog/datasets/internet-topology-data-kit/)
- **static_files**: This folder contains some useful datasets like [CAIDA AS to organization](https://www.caida.org/archive/as2org/), BGP prefixes from [Anycatch](https://bgp.tools/kb/anycatch), etc.
- **hostname_files**: Hostname files are all intermediary files we used and produced to select the hostname GeoResolver relies on to calculate the redirection distance between vantage points' subnets and targets one, starting with the [top 1M CrUX table](https://github.com/zakird/crux-top-lists).
- **experiment_configs**: Some configuration example to use GeoResolver along with its docker image.
- other files: These other files contains vantage points that were filter because of wrongful geolocation, best hostnames retrieved ranked function of their hosting diversity, etc.

## Download and install Clickhouse tables

We provide an installer to download and install Clickhouse tables in your own local instance. Simply run:
```bash
python configuration/installer.py
```
or 
```bash
poetry run python configuration/installer.py
```

This script will download all files listed as input parameters from the FTP server, create the corresponding table into Clickhouse (DNS/Ping/etc.) and import the data. Below you will find a short description of the default tables.

**Description**
- **Ping tables**:
    - **vps_meshed_pings**:
    - **meshed_ping_cdns**:
- **DNS tables**:
    - **vps_ecs_mapping**:
    - **meshed_ecs_cdns**:
- **VPs tables**:
    - **vps_raw**:
    - **vps_filtered**:
    - **vps_filtered_final**:


Gongratulation, you are throught with GeoResolver's installation!

# üî¨ Run Evaluation

All results present in GeoResolver's original paper are fully replicable. All the necessary scripts can be found in [georesolver/evaluation/](georesolver/evaluation/).
For the sake of simplicity, we propose a single script to run all evaluation at: [georesolver/evaluation/evaluation_all.py](georesolver/evaluation/evaluation_all.py):
```bash
python georesolver/evaluation/evaluation_all.py
```
or 
```bash
poetry run python georesolver/evaluation/evaluation_all.py
```

Otherwise, you can run each script separately. You will notice that some step of these evaluation scripts are skipped. It is because these scripts can also be used to run the measurement used for the evaluation. **WE DO NOT RECOMMEND** running them as these measurement put a significant load on RIPE Atlas plateform. Indeed, most of them perform *meshed measurements*, i.e. measurement from all vantage points to a set of targets, which is very costly.

Instead, in the following section, we propose you to run your own measurements using GeoResolver, as it is leightweight and operate with a fixed cost of 50 vantage points to geolocate each target IP address.

**Description**
- **figure_2_center_figure_5.py**: 

# üó∫Ô∏è Run your own experiments

Run GeoResolver script:
```bash
python georesolver/scripts/local_demo.py
```
or
```bash
poetry run python georesolver/scripts/local_demo.py
```

Note that this section will require you to have a RIPE Atlas account with enought credits to run your measurement. Create your [RIPE Atlas account]() if you do not have one and request credits if needed (RIPE Atlas offers credits to researchers when requested). 

This python script select a random set of 100 IP addresses from the ITDK ICMP responsive IP addresses. It then run GeoResolver geolocation engine on this set of IP addresses. GeoResolver start 4 processes in parrallel:
1. **ECS process**: Run ECS-DNS queries on all target's subnets.
2. **Score process**: Compute the redirection distance between the ECS resolution of over all vantage points and the one obtain for the targets.
3. **Ping process**: Select the vantage points with the smallest redirection distance and post the measurement on RIPE Atlas.
4. **Insert process**: Insert ping measurement into a clickhouse table.

GeoResolver adopt a *waterfall* design, meaning that each process works in batch, starting with the ECS process. Once a batch is done, it triggers the Score process which, when done, triggers the Ping process and so on. You can follow the execution of each process by inspecting the logs at [georesolver/logs/local_demo/]() where each process has its own log file.

At the end, you should have 4 tables: local_demo_ecs, local_demo_score, local_demo_ping and local_demo_geoloc (which contains the result of the geolocation based on the shortest ping vantage point geolocation). Addiotionally, you can run [georesolver/scripts/geoloc_map.py](georesolver/scripts/geoloc_map.py) to obtain a map of your geolocated IP addresses (by default this script only output IP addresses geolocated under 2ms):
```bash
python geresolver/scripts/geoloc_map.py 
```

**Note 1**: You can reniew vantage points ECS-DNS resolution by setting the following variable to True in the JSON config of [georesolver/scripts/geoloc_map.py](georesolver/scripts/geoloc_map.py):
```python

```

**Note 2**: You can choose to load any target file as input (this is the script we used to run GeoResolver on the ITDK dataset), just check that your IP addresses answer to pings! (As mentionned in the paper, GeoResolver methodology works for IPv6 but we did not yet have the tool available for it).
